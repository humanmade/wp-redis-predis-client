# WP Redis - Predis Client

This is a package that enables the use of [Predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis/) as a Redis Client as opposed to PHPRedis for [WP Redis](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-redis/). Predis has the distinct advantage of connecting to Redis via TLS, encrypting traffic in-transit. Requires WP Redis >= 0.7.0.

## Getting Started

### Requiring Files
#### Composer

When using Composer, `functions.php` file will automatically be loaded whenever you include Composer's autoloader in your project.

#### Manually Requiring

The only file needing `require_once`ing for WP Predis to work correctly is `functions.php` (which is automatically included via `vendor/autoload.php`, which is generated by Composer). Download this repo somewhere in your project, run `composer install`, and include `vendor/autoload.php` somewhere early (such as `wp-config.php`):

```
require_once '/path/to/wp-redis-predis-client/vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Object Cache stub


Now that files have been included, it's recommended you use the included [`object-cache.php`](object-cache.php) file instead of the one included with WP Redis. It will add the required filters for WP Predis to work and then include WP Redis' `object-cache.php` file. Once `object-cache.php` is in `wp-content` (or whatever content directory you are using), you're good to go!

### Configuring Predis

WP Redis - Predis Client adheres to WP Redis' [configuration details](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-redis#installation). Predis also takes an additional argument, `ssl`, for configuring TLS connections. See PHP's [SSL Context options](http://php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php) for more details.


```php
global $redis_server;
$redis_server = array(
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'port' => 6379,
    'ssl'  => array(
        'local_cert' => '/path/to/certificate_and_key.pem',
        'verify_peer' => true,
    ),
);
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Predis 3.2.0 or higher
- WordPress (when used in production)

## Testing

This package includes comprehensive tests for both standalone and WordPress integration scenarios.

### Quick Test

Run the test suite locally (requires Redis):

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Start Redis
docker run -d --name redis-test -p 6379:6379 redis:latest

# Run tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Stop Redis
docker stop redis-test && docker rm redis-test
```

### Docker Testing (Multiple PHP Versions)

Test across multiple PHP versions using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d redis

# Run tests with PHP 8.2
docker compose run --rm test-php82 vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run tests with PHP 8.3
docker compose run --rm test-php83 vendor/bin/phpunit

# Stop services
docker compose down
```
